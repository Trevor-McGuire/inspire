Add functionality for updating groups and items: In version 1.0, you have the ability to create and delete groups and items. For version 2.0, you could add functionality for updating existing groups and items. This could include the ability to edit the name and description of a group or item, as well as the ability to add or remove items from a group.

Improve the UI: In version 1.0, you have a basic UI for creating and deleting groups and items. For version 2.0, you could focus on improving the UI to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing. This could include adding animations, improving the layout and design, and adding more intuitive controls for interacting with the app.

Add new features: In addition to updating existing functionality and improving the UI, you could also consider adding new features to the app. For example, you could add the ability to tag items with keywords or categories, or the ability to search for items based on specific criteria.

Refactor the code: As you add new functionality and features to the app, you may find that the code becomes more complex and difficult to manage. For version 2.0, you could consider refactoring the code to make it more modular and easier to maintain. This could include breaking the code into smaller components, using more descriptive variable names, and removing any unnecessary code or dependencies.
